# Source Control
# https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/source-control/

# It is recommended that you keep fastlane configuration files in the repository. You may want to add the following lines to the repository's .gitignore (Git) or .hgignore (Mercurial) file to exclude generated and temporary files:

# fastlane specific
**/fastlane/report.xml

# deliver temporary files
**/fastlane/Preview.html

# snapshot generated screenshots
**/fastlane/screenshots

# scan temporary files
**/fastlane/test_output

# build
**/fastlane/build

# It is also recommended that you avoid storing screenshots or other delivery artifacts in the repository. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate whenever needed.

# Fastlane Environment
**/fastlane/.env.default
